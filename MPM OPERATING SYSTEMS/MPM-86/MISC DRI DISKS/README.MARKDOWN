This archive is from in-house diskettes and has snippets of MP/M-86 code from DRI development and includes some other code unrelated to MP/M-86. It includes pieces of MP/M-86 code in the process of being debugged never released before. It comes with teledisk images and scans of labels since there are erased files on them you may want to recover (previous versions of code being developed).

/README.TXT

These are the last of my DRI "original" disks.

These disks do not have Factory labels, they were in-house disks.

Many are development disks for MP/M-86 and contain pieces of code
in varying degrees of debugging.  There are some boot disks for
DRI in-house computers.  There are other disks for different projects.

I used 22disk to transfer the files to DOS when possible.  22Disk
renames CP/M .COM files to .CPM.  Four disks may be formatted for a VAX,
they have 128 byte sectors on track 00 then change to 256 byte sectors
with a directory on track 6.  DRI used a VAX to cross compile the PLM-86
code.  I did not transfer the individual files from these four disks.

I also used Teledisk v2.15 to create disk images of all of the disks.

Some disks have deleted files that can possibly be recovered if anyone
wants.

I also scanned the disks and included the scans.

Many disks had errors but none of the disks here had any errors
transferring the files.  Most of the disks with errors had them on
track 00 and have no effect on the directory or files :)

One disk was totally unreadable but I scanned the label because it
was labeled strangely.

![Disk Label Scan](Odd unreadable DRI disk.JPG "Unreadable disk")

One is serialized (#14) which appears to be a master MP/M-86 v2.0 disk,
it is serial number M86-000-00001.  Along with copies of the disks
before and after it would probably be sent to an OEM such as ALTOS,
as written on some of the labels to be copied serialized and sent out
with the computers.

The serial numbers have a simple code, using the above example M86
stands for MP/M-86, the 000 refers to Pacific Grove, the 00001 is the
sequence.  In a separate archive you will see a disk with serial number
MS0-000-00001 where MS0 stands for Pascal MT+ with SPP.
