?General
General information on MP/M 8-16

MP/M 8-16 is a proprietary implementation of Digital Research's MP/M-86
operating system from Gifford Computer Systems.  This implementation of
MP/M-86 enables systems with CompuPro hardware to run both 8- and 16-bit
programs simultaneously in a multi-user, multi-tasking environment.
?sw
The SW feature of MP/M 8-16

The SW  program is the most innovative part of Gifford Computer Systems'
enhancements to MP/M-86.  This program enables the system's 8- and 16-bit
file access capability.

When the user gives a command on the MP/M 8-16 command line, the shell
first searches the directories for CP/M-86 (16-bit) files with a .CMD
extension. If a .CMD file is not found, the shell automatically
invokes SW, which searches for a CP/M-80 (8-bit) program with the same
file name, but with a .COM extension. 
?SUBMIT
Using SUBMIT with MP/M 8-16

Although the SW program is called automatically by the shell when you ask
for an 8-bit program, the SUBMIT facility does not know how to do this.
Thus, you must explicitly give the A:SW command on lines of a SUBMIT file
that call 8-bit programs.  For example, if you want to run an 8-bit program
called F80 on a file called BILLING.FOR, and then erase the file called
BILLING.LST, your SUBMIT file would have the following two lines:

     A:SW F80 BILLING.FOR
     ERA BILLING.LST
?CLOCK
Setting the time with the CLOCK command

MP/M-86 has a TOD command which allows setting the time, but will not work
under MP/M 8-16. MP/M 8-16 uses the real-time clock on the System Support
board to set the time instead of the time derived from the TOD program.
Instead of using TOD command to set the time, use the CLOCK command.  TOD
will still return the correct time.

Unless the NiCad battery back-up is disconnected from your System Support
board, you only have to set the time once.  The System Support board may be
removed from the computer and reinstalled later as long as the battery is
always connected to the board. The NiCad battery will last for about two
years.
?MPMINIT
MPMINIT.CMD and MPMINIT.SUB

Before giving the user at the system console control of the system, it
first checks for files called MPMINIT.CMD and MPMINIT.SUB on user 0 of disk
A:.  If it finds MPMINIT.CMD, it runs the program. It then looks for
MPMINIT.SUB; if it finds it, it runs SUBMIT with the file. For example, you
can use the MPMINIT files to check the status of the disks, and the amount
of disk space available.

?USERINIT
USERINIT.CMD and USERINIT.SUB

When a user gives a correct login name (and password, if necessary), the
system checks user 0 of drive A: for files called USERINIT.CMD and
USERINIT.SUB.  If it finds USERINIT.CMD, it runs the program.  It then
looks for USERINIT.SUB; if it finds it, it then runs SUBMIT with the file.
These programs are run for all users.
?Passwords
Passwords on the system

There are two types of passwords on MP/M 8-16.  You can protect files and
you can prevent unauthorized users from logging onto the system.  The file
protection is documented in the "MP/M-86 Operating System User's Guide" in
the section on files.  The login protection is documented in the "MP/M 8-16
Reference Manual" in the section on the PASSWD file.

For more information on the PASSWD file, give the command HELP MPM PASSWD.
?PASSWD
The structure of the PASSWD file is:

NAME:PASSWORD:DRIVE:USER:PRINTER:ACCESS:PROGRAM:COMMENTS
|__| |______| |___| |__| |_____| |____| |_____| |_______
  \      \       \    \     \       \       \         \
   1      2       3    4     5       6       7         8

1.  User login name
2.  Optional password field
3.  Optional default user drive (default = drive A)
4.  Optional default user number (default = user 0)
5.  Optional default user printer (default = printer 0)
6.  Optional selective terminal access numbers. This is a comma separated
list of the console numbers users will be  allowed to use. If no assignment
is made in this field, the user has access to any terminal.
7.  Optional default application program, such as SuperCalc.  Users with an
entry in this field are automatically entered into the program specified.
The system searches for the program exactly as if the user had typed at the
default prompt. Upon exiting the program, the user is automatically logged
out.
8.  Optional comments field
?TTYS
The structure of the TTYS file

DEV #:BAUD RATE:HANDSHAKING:PROTOCOL:TTY NAME:COMMENTS
|___| |_______| |_________| |______| |______| |_______
  \       \          \            \      \         \
   1       2          3            4      5         6

1.  Number of terminal, corresponding to connection on computer back panel.
Numbers begin with 0.

2.  Terminal baud rate; the default is 9600. Baud rates are selected from
the following:

0  =  9600     1  =   110     2  =   300     3  =   600     4  =  1200
5  =  1800     6  =  2400     7  =  4800     8  =  9600     9  = 19200
A  = automatic baud rate detection for modems

3.  Optional RS-232 hardware handshaking. Hardware handshaking is generally
not required for terminals; if not specified, the default is 0.  If
handshaking is necessary, enter the number corresponding to the type of
handshaking needed from the following:
0 = No handshaking
1 = Hardware handshaking (DTR) (RS-232 pin 20)
2 = Software handshaking (XON XOFF)
3 = Reserved for custom application

4.  Optional communications protocol.  This is a three character entry. The
default protocol is 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, and no parity, which are the
settings for most common terminals.  If you need to change this, select the
configuration you need from the table below and enter the three characters
without any spaces.  For example, if your terminal requires a protocol of 7
data bits, 2 stop bits, even parity, enter 72E in field 4.

Data bits  Stop bits  Parity

    8          2        N (none)
    7          1        O (odd)
                        E (even)

5.  Optional terminal name of up to 8 characters with no spaces. The
terminal name is often entered as "console" for the system console, "tty1"
for terminal 1, "tty2" for terminal 2, etc.  This field is used to identify
the location on the system of a user in the WHO facility, and will be used
in future MP/M 8-16 utilities.  More than one terminal name can be listed,
separated by commas with no spaces.

6.  Optional comments field.
?LPRS
The structure of the LPRS file.

DEV #:BAUD RATE:HANDSHAKING:PROTOCOL:LPR NAME:COMMENT
|___| |_______| |_________| |______| |______| |______
  \       \          \          \        \         \
   1       2          3          4        5         6

section.  The value here is used in the MPM-86 PRINTER command, which
changes the default printer for a user.
6.  Optional comment field.
?WTMP
The structure of the WTMP file

A sample entry is:
tty2 david     2 16642132392034 7221982    4

The first two fields are the terminal name and  user name. The contents
of the other fields are:

2 1664 21 32 39 203 4  7 22 1982    4
 \  \   \  \  \  \  \       \        \

3.  Hour of the day (24 hour clock).
4.  Minute of the hour.
5.  Second of the minute.
6.  Julian day of the year (1-365)
7.  Day of the week (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, Tuesday = 3, etc.)
8.  Date in month-day-year.
9.  Program file link number; the first entry defines the length of the
file.
?MAIL
The MAIL Utility

The MAIL utility lets you send mail to, and receive mail from, other users.
For more information on MAIL, give the command HELP MAIL or HELP MAIL ALL.
?Reminder
Reminder files

Each time you log on the system, MP/M 8-16 checks user area 15 on disk A:
for a file called name.REM, where "name" is the name being logged in.  If
it finds the file, it types it on your screen.
?MOTD
The Message of the Day

Each time a user logs in, the system types out the message of the day. The
message is kept in the file called MOTD on user 0 on drive.  This file can
contain anything you wish, including escape sequences to control the user's
screen.  Create and update the MOTD file with an editor such as ED or
WordStar.
?FORMAT
Formatting diskettes and disks

Floppy diskettes used with the MP/M  8-16 system must be formatted before
being used to transfer or store information.  The FORMAT program included
on your system diskette formats both single and double density diskettes,
and the recommended format is double density diskettes formatted for 1024
byte sectors.

It is extremely unlikely that you will need to format your hard disk once
it is in use.  Formatting a disk erases all of the information on it.  It
is also unlikely that you will want to run the destructive disk test, since
this also destroys the information on your disk.
?help
The HELP facility

The HELP command gives you more information about the system, or about
programs supplied with the system.  You can also make your own help files,
or modify the ones we supply.

To get general information on a subject, simply type HELP and the program
name.  The HELP program will access that help file, and the subject of
GENERAL.  To get a list of the subjects in a help file, give the command
"HELP filename ALL".
?TOD
The TOD Command in MP/M 8-16

The TOD command prints out the current time of day.  Under MP/M 8-16, it
does not set the system clock.  This is done with the CLOCK program. For
more information, type HELP MPM CLOCK.
?PRINTER
The PRINTER Command in MP/M 8-16

The PRINTER command takes the names of printers, as well as their number,
as arguments in MP/M 8-16.  For more information on printer names, type
HELP MPM LPRS.
?COPY
The COPY command

To make an exact copy of the system diskette, use one of the formatted
diskettes supplied by Gifford Computer Systems, or format a diskette with
the FORMAT program, choosing 1024 byte sectors. You must boot the system
with CP/M 2.2, then give the COPY command.
?SYSGEN
The SYSGEN command

Use the SYSGEN command to copy the system tracks of a boot diskette to
another diskette.
?Shutdown
Shutting down your system

It is important that you follow these procedures each time you turn off
your system or reset it (re-initialize by pressing the reset button),
especially if you are running your system with a hard disk. These steps
ensure that data is written from the hard disk cache. Failure to follow
them may result in loss of valuable data.

1. All users (except system console) log off of the system by giving the
LOGOUT command.

2. After all the other users have logged out, the user at the system
console gives the DOWN command. This turns off all terminals except the
system console.

3. Release the system diskette from the floppy disk drive. Hold in the red
reset button on the front of the Enclosure 2, turn off power to the
computer by pressing the bottom part of the power switch down, and release
the reset button.
?DOWN
The DOWN command

The DOWN command turns off all terminals except the system console.  For
more information, type HELP MPM SHUTDOWN.
?MAKE
The MAKE command

The MAKE command creates an empty file on your disk. This is useful if you
need to make a file that does not contain any information, but the
existence of the file is important to other programs. To make a file, give
the MAKE command and the file name at the system prompt. For example, to
create the file TEST.FIL, type MAKE TEST.FIL at the system prompt.
?WHO
The WHO command

The WHO command lists the users on the system, their consoles, and the
time they logged on.
?TIMELOG
The TIMELOG utilities

Gifford Computer Systems provides dBASE II utilities to get login histories
of users and terminals on your MP/M 8-16 system. These utilities read from
the WTMP file, and write out a dBASE II data base.
?SuperCalc
SuperCalc

Your system includes a copy of SuperCalc, which is a financial spread-sheet
program which is used to forecast costs and benefits for businesses.  To
run SuperCalc, give the SC command.

If you need help when running SuperCalc, type the question mark (?) key.
?dBASE
dBASE II

Your system includes a copy of dBASE II, which is a complete data base
management system.  To run dBASE II, give the DBASE command.
?SYNC
The SYNC command

The SYNC command copies the cache disk buffers to the hard disk. MP/M 8-16
systems with hard disks use cache memory to improve the speed of accessing
the disk. This means, however, that there are times when RAM memory
contains information that has not been written on the hard disk.

The system does an automatic SYNC command every 30 seconds. If you want to
flush the cache memory before then, give the SYNC command.
?languages
Programming languages

Gifford Computer Systems sells the following computer languages:

Assemblers -- SORCIM ACT-80, ACT-86, Trans86.  Digital Research SID (8- and
16-bit), MAC, RMAC

BASIC -- Microsoft's BASIC interpreter and compiler (8-bit); Digital
Research's CBASIC (8- and 16-bit) interpreter, and CB80 compiler (8-bit)

C -- Computer Innovations C86 (16-bit); Whitesmith's C (8-bit)

Pascal -- SORCIM's Pascal/M (8- and 16-bit); Digital Research's Pascal MT+
(8- and 16-bit, Speed Programming Package available)

FORTRAN -- Microsoft FORTRAN (8-bit)

PL/1 -- Digital Research PL/1 (8-bit)
?ABORT
The ABORT command

ABORT stops execution of a process. The syntax is:

ABORT process n

where process is the name of the program to be aborted, and n is the
terminal number that the program is running on.
?ASM86
The MP/M-86 Assembler

The ASM86 assembles assembly language statements, and produces an object
file in hexadecimal format. It is documented in the MP/M-86 Operating
System Programmer's Guide.
?ATTACH
The ATTACH command

The ATTACH command attaches a detached program.  The syntax is:

ATTACH process

where process is the name of the detached program.
?CONSOLE
The CONSOLE command types the number of the user's console.
?DDT86
The dynamic debugger

The DDT86 program aids the dynamic debugging of MP/M-86 programs. It is
documented in the MP/M-86 Operating System Programmer's Guide.
?DIR
The DIR command

The DIR command displays a list of files that are on a disk. The name
specified to the DIR command can have wildcards. For more information on
wildcards in file names, type HELP MPM WILDCARDS. You can also use the
[SYS] option of DIR to list files with the system attribute.

To list files on a user number other than the one you are connected to, use
the [G] option with the number of the area.  For example, to list all of
the files on user 6, give the command "DIR *.*[G6]".
?DSKRESET
The DSKRESET command

Give the DSKRESET command before removing a floppy diskette from a drive.
This prevents you from destroying another person's data if they are also
accessing that diskette.  If you do not give an argument to DSKRESET, all
drives are reset.  You can specify the individual drives that you want to
reset.
?ED
The ED editor

The ED command allows you to edit files.  It is documented in the MP/M-86
Operating System User's Guide.  The ED editor is not very sophisticated, and
Gifford Computer Systems recommends the use of other editors, such as
WordStar, instead of ED for most applications.
?ERA
The ERA command

Erase files from your disk with the ERA command.  The ERA command accepts
wildcard specifications (for more information on wildcards, give the HELP
MPM WILDCARDS command).
?ERAQ
The ERAQ command

Selectively erase files from your disk with the ERAQ command.  This command
is similar to the ERA command, except that it prompts you before each file,
so that you can erase only some of a given group.
?GENCMD
The GENCMD Command

Use GENCMD to create .CMD command files from hex file (such as ones created
with the ASM86 command).  The GENCMD command  is documented in the MP/M-86
Operating System Programmer's Guide.
?MPMSTAT
The MPMSTAT command

The MPMSTAT command displays information about the internal status of your
MP/M 8-16 system.  The information displayed by MPMSTAT take up more than a
full screen, and generally is not useful to the casual user.
?wildcards
Using wildcard characters in file specifications

An asterisk (*) in the filename or filetype is replaced by any number of
characters in the filename that is searched. A question mark (?) in the
filename or filetype is replaced by one character in the filename that is
searched.

For example, the command "DIR BA*.TXT" will list BANNER.TXT and BAD.TXT,
but not BURNER.TXT.  The command "DIR BA?.TXT" will list BAD.TXT, but not
BANNER.TXT.
?PIP
The PIP command

The PIP command moves files from a disk to another file, or to an external
device (such as a printer). The format of the command is:

PIP destination=source

You can use wildcard characters in the filename. For an explanation of
wildcard specifications, type HELP MPM WILDCARDS.

The destination is the name of a file to be created, the name of a disk
(the same file name as the source will be used), or LST: (to print out the
file).

There are many options that you can specify to modify the PIP command.
When copying a file from one disk to another, you should always use the V
and O options.  If you are copying all of the files from one disk to
another, and want to update files that are on the destination disk, use the
options V, R, O, and W.  To copy all of the files from A: to B:, give the
command:

PIP B:=A:*.*[VROW]

The options that are most commonly used are:

A  - archive
Gn - "Goto" user n.  If this is specified on the destination file, this
     writes the file to user n.  If it is specified on the source file,
     it reads the file from user n.
K  - Kill console display during a wildcard file transfer.
O  - Object file transfers.  This option should always be used.
R  - Read files that have the system attribute set.
Tn - Expand TAB characters to n spaces. This is useful when listing programs
     on printers.
V  - Verify that the data is copied correctly after each record is written.
     This option should always be used when transferring files from one disk
     to another.
W  - Write over files that have the read-only attribute.
?REN
The REN command

Rename files on a disk with the REN command. The format is:

REN newname=oldname

The command will accept wildcards if they appear in the same place in both
the new and old names (e.g., REN MYPROG.*=YOURPROG.*).  For more
information on wildcards, type HELP MPM WILDCARDS.
?SDIR
The SDIR command

The SDIR command displays a list of files that are on a disk. The name
specified to the SDIR command can have wildcards. For more information on
wildcards in file names, type HELP MPM WILDCARDS.

The SDIR command is different than the DIR command since it takes many more
options, displays more information about each file, and sorts the file by
filename and file type.  The options most commonly used are:

SYS - list all files with the system attribute
DIR - list all files with the directory attribute
RO - list all files with the read-only attribute
RW - list all files with the read-write attribute
USER=n - list the files from user number n
USER=ALL - list the files from all user numbers
USER=(n1,n2,...) - list the files from user number n1, n2,...
DRIVE=d - list the files from drive d
DRIVE=ALL - list the files from all connected drives
DRIVE=(d1,d2,...) - list the files from drives d1, d2,...
EXCLUDE - list all files except those specified in the command

The default is to list all RW, RO, SYS, and DIR files.

You can get help for the SDIR command by giving the command SDIR HELP.
?SET
The SET command

The SET command is used to set the attributes on files and disks. The
name specified to the SET command can have wildcards. For more
information on wildcards in file names, type HELP MPM WILDCARDS. 

The options are:

Disks:
SET d: [RO or RW] - set the disk read-only or read-write
SET d: [NAME=name] - give a name to the disk
SET d: [PASSWORD = password, PROTECT=ON, DEFAULT=password] - password
         protection
SET d: [MAKE=ON, CREATE=ON, ACCESS=ON, UPDATE=ON] - XFCB creation

Files:
SET filespec [RO or RW, DIR or SYS] - set the file(s) read-only or
         read-write, and directory or system
SET filespec [PASSWORD = password, TIME = ON] - set the password and
         timestamping
SET filespec [PROTECT = READ or WRITE or DELETE or NONE] - set the protection

You can get help for the SET command by giving the command SET HELP.
?SHOW
The SHOW command

The SHOW command displays information about disks on your MP/M 8-16 system.
If no argument is given, the amount of space left on the drive is displayed.
The options are:

USERS - displays each user and the files on the disk that are allocated to
        them.
DRIVES - lists extended information for each drive, such as the number
         of directory entries.
LABEL - displays the label, password protection, XFCB status, timestamp
        status, and update time of the disk.

You can get help for the SHOW command by giving the command SHOW HELP.
?SPOOL
The SPOOL command

The SPOOL command sends files to the printer.  The syntax is:

SPOOL file1, file2, ...

The spooler can be stopped with the STOPSPLR command.
?STAT
The STAT command gives information about disks and files, and sets the
read-only protection on files.  In MP/M 8-16, it is superseded by the
SET and SHOW commands.
?STOPSPLR
The STOPSPLR command stops the print spooler.  For information on using
the print spooler, type HELP MPM SPOOL.
?TYPE
The TYPE command

The TYPE command types files on your terminal.
?USER
The USER command

The USER command changes your user number.
tions are:

USERS - displays each user and the files on the disk that are allocated to
