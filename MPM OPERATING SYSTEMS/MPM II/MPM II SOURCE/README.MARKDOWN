MP/M II source. While most of the utilities are in PLM, the OS code is in 8080 assembler. NOTE : There may be a PLM80 compiler in this package.

Greetings,

Here is the source for MP/M II. This is a rare find, and I'm very happy
to be able to offer it. The files are in a directory tree that corresponds
to the way they were stored on the disks I got them from. Here's what it
where :

NOTE : When you unzip the files be sure to use PKZIP -d to restore the 
directory structure.

\MPM2\                  ROOT DIRECTORY FOR THIS ARCHIVE
\MPM2\NUCLEUS           NUCLEUS, BDOS : DISK 1, USER 0

\MPM2\PLM_WORK          PLM WORK DISK : DISK 3, USER 1

NOTE : The last directory, \MPM2\PLM_WORK, may contain a woorking copy of a
PLM80 compiler.

Many thanks to James Willing for this valuable package.

Enjoy,
