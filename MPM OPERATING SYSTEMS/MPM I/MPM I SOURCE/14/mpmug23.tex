2.4  Extended Disk Operating System Functions
.pp
The Extending Disk Operating System (XDOS) functions are covered in
this section by describing the entry parameters and returned values
for each XDOS function.  The XDOS calling conventions are identical
to those of the BDOS which are described in
OPERATING SYSTEM CALL CONVENTIONS in section 2.1.

The ABSOLUTE MEMORY REQUEST function allocates
an absolute block of memory specified by the passed memory descriptor
parameter.  This
function allows non-relocatable programs,
such as CP/M *.COM files based at the absolute TPA address of
0100H, to run in
the MP/M 1.0 environment.  The single passed parameter is the address
of a memory descriptor.  The memory descriptor contains four bytes:
the memory segment base page address, the memory segment page size,
the memory segment attributes, and bank.  The only parameters
filled in by the user
are the base and size, the other parameters are filled in by XDOS.
.pp
The operation returns a "boolean" indicating whether or not the
allocation was made.
A returned value of FFH indicates failure to allocate the requested
memory and a value of 0 indicates success.
Note that base and size specify base page address and page size where
a page is 256 bytes.

The POLL function polls the specified device
until a ready condition is received.  The calling process relinquishes
the processor until the poll is satisfied, allowing other processes
to execute.
.pp
Note that the POLL function is intended for use in the custom XIOS
since an association is made in the XIOS between the device number
and the actual code executed for the poll operation.  This does not
exclude other uses of the poll function but it does mean that an
application program making a poll call must be matched to a specific
XIOS.

.PP
The FLAG WAIT function causes a process to
relinquish the processor until the flag specified in the call is set.
The flag wait operation is used in an interrupt driven
system to cause the calling process to 'wait' until a specific
interrupt condition occurs.
.pp
The operation returns a boolean indicating whether or not a successful
FLAG WAIT was performed.  A returned value of FFH indicates that no
flag wait occurred because another process was already waiting on
the specified flag.  A returned value of 0 indicates success.
.pp
Note that flags are non-queued, which means that access to flags
must be carefully managed.  Typically the physical interrupt handlers
will set flags while a single process will wait on each flag.

The FLAG SET function wakes up a waiting process.
The FLAG SET function is usually called by an interrupt service
routine after servicing an interrupt and determining which flag is
to be set.
.ti +6
The operation returns a boolean indicating whether or not a successful
FLAG SET was performed.  A returned value of FFH indicates that a flag
over-run has occurred, i.e. the flag was already set when a flag set

***************************************
.PP
The MAKE QUEUE function sets up a queue control
block.  A queue is configured as either circular or linked depending
upon the message size.  Message sizes of 0 to 2 bytes use circular
queues while message sizes of 3 or more bytes use linked queues.
.PP
A single parameter is passed to make a queue, the queue control block
address.  The queue control block must contain the queue name, message
length, number of messages, and sufficient space to accomodate the
messages (and links if the queue is linked).
.pp
The queue control block data structures for both circular and linked
queues are described in section 2.3.
.pp
Queues can only be created either in common memory or by
user programs in non-banked systems.  The reason is that
queues are all maintained on a linked list which must be
accessible at all times.  I.E., a queue cannot reside in a
memory segment which is bank switched.  However, a queue
created in common memory can be accessed by all system and
user programs.

The OPEN QUEUE function places the actual queue
control block address into the user queue control block.
The result of this function is that a user program can obtain access
to queues by knowing only the queue name, the actual address
of the queue itself is obtained as a result of opening the queue.
Once a queue has been opened, the queue may be read from or written to
using the queue read and write operations.
.PP
The function returns a boolean indicating whether or not the open
queue operation found the queue to be opened.  A returned value of
0FFH indicates failure while a zero indicates success.

***************************************
.PP
The DELAY function delays execution of the
calling process for the specified number of system time units.
Use of the delay operation avoids the typical programmed delay
loop.  It allows other processes to use the processor while the
specified period of time elapses.  The system time unit is typically
60 Hz (16.67 milliseconds) but may vary according to application.
For example it is likely that in Europe it would be 50 Hz (20
milliseconds).
.PP
The delay is specifed as a 16-bit integer.  Since calling the delay
procedure is usually asynchronous to the actual time base itself, there
is up to one tick of uncertainty in the exact amount of time delayed.
Thus a delay of 10 ticks gaurantees a delay of at least 10 ticks, but
it may be nearly 11 ticks.

***************************************
.PP
The DISPATCH operation allows the operating system
to determine the highest priority ready process and then to give it the
processor.  This call is provided in XDOS to allow systems without
interrupts the capability of sharing the processor among compute
bound processes.  Since all user processes usually run at the same
priority, invoking the dispatch operation at various points
in a program will allow other users to obtain the processor
in a round-robin fashion.
Invoking the dispatch function does not take the calling process off
of the ready list.
.PP
Dispatch is intended for non-interrupt driven environments in
which it is desirable to enable a compute bound process
to relinquish the use of the processor.
.pp
Another use of the dispatch function is to safely enable interrupts
following the execution of a disable interrupt instruction (DI).

The TERMINATE PROCESS function terminates
the calling process.  The passed parameters indicate whether
or not the process should be terminated if it is a system process
and if the memory segment is to be released.
A 0FFH in the E register indicates that the process should be unconditionally terminated,
a zero indicates that only a user process is to be deleted.
If  a user process is being terminated and Register D is  a
0FFH, the memory segment is not released.  Thus a process
which is a child of a parent process both executing in  the
same  memory  segment  can terminate  without  freeing  the
memory segment which is also occupied by the parent.

A single parameter is passed, the address of a process
descriptor.  The first field of the process descriptor is a link
field which may point to another process descriptor.
.pp
Processes can only be created either in common memory or by
user  programs in non-banked systems.  The reason is  that
process  descriptors  are all maintained  on  linked  lists
which must be accessible at all times.
.pp
The process descriptor data structure is described in section 2.3.

The ASSIGN CONSOLE function directly assigns
the console to a specified process.  This assignment is done regardless
of whether or not the console is currently attached to some other
process.
A single parameter is passed to assign console which is the address
of a data structure containing the console number for the assignment,
an 8 character ASCII process name, and a boolean indicating whether
or not a match with the console field of the process descriptor
is required (true or 0FFH indicates it is required).
.PP
The operation returns a boolean indicating whether or not the
assignment was made.  A returned value of 0FFH indicates failure to
assign the console, either because a process descriptor with the
specified name could not be found, or that a match was required and
the console field of the process descriptor did not match the
specified console.  A returned value of zero indicates a successful
assignment.

The SEND CLI COMMAND function permits running
programs to send command lines to the Command Line Interpreter.
A single parameter is passed which is the address of a data
structure containing the default disk/user code, console and command
line itself (shown below).
.pp
The default disk/user code is the first byte of the data structure.
The high order four bits contain the default disk drive and the low
order four bits contain the user code.  The second byte of the data
structure
contains the console number for the program being executed.  The
ASCII command line begins with the third byte and is terminated with
a null byte.
