Please give me credit for the code.

You might even consider putting in a two line tribute to the late Gary Kildall.

Andy has requested that those who use this code pause to consider where we would 
be if the late Gary Kildall, a pioneer's pioneer, had not taken the time to write CP/M.
 
If you want to know the *real* story, I can recommend the book "They Made America" by Sir Harold Evans. It will tell you just how significant Gary's work was, and how Mr. Gates got to where he is.
The second edition has a far more complete story.

Andy
