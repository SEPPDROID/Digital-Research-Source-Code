z80em86 Software distributions
==============================
The latest source and binary distributions are available from:

http://www.cpm.z80.de/source.html
http://www.gaby.de/z80/z80emu.htm

The "n.n.n" is the version number:

z80em86-n.n.n.tar.gz  : Source files
z80em86-n.n.n-dos.zip : Binary in ZIP format for DOS (and Windows)

Installation
============
For DOS/Windows systems the binary ZIP may be used.  On Linux systems a DOS
binary can be installed under DosEmu after the sources have been built or
the binary distribution may also be used.

DOS ZIP file
------------
1. Unzip the DOS z80em86-n.n.n-dos.zip binary distribution to a
   location you wish to use.  If you have a previous installation then you
   can just unzip over the top of the other.
2. Follow the instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS'.

SOURCE BUILD/INSTALL
--------------------
During the Make process the 'ALINK' linker sources will be automatically
downloaded, modified and built, the file is less than 50K in size.  The
download process normally only needs to run once as the file will be cached
in the build area.

$ tar -xzf z80em86-n.n.n.tar.gz    (n.n.n is the version number)
$ cd z80em86-n.n.n/src

$ make

If the current user has access to DosEmu (~/.dosemu/drive_c/...) then the
emulator can be installed in that location and run under DosEmu.

$ make install

Follow the instructions under 'ALL SYSTEMS' before proceeding.

The emulator can be run from the Makefile or by starting DosEmu and changing
directory to the installed location.

To run from the Makefile (after install):

$ make run      run booting Z80HDD.DSK under dosemu
$ make runa     run forcing booting A: under dosemu
$ make runb     run forcing booting B: under dosemu

ALL SYSTEMS
-----------
A Z80 operating system may be placed in the 'z80em86' directory as a HDD
image disk file or a system from a floppy drive may be booted.  A CP/M 3
system suitable for running under the emulator is available.  See the
doc/README file for further information.

A z80hdd.exe utility in the 'z80em86' directory can be used to create a 4MB
formatted HDD disk image.
