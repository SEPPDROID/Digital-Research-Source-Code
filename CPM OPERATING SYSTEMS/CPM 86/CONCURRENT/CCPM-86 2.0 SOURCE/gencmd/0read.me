GENCMD status: debugging CS version 		2/21/83
GENCMD notes
2/22/83 got Chuck Spitz version from Kathy, along with directions
	on how to fix for >62K data segs
2/9/83 Kathy promises latest version asap.   whf
10/21/82 I got this version from CCPMPC.
GENCMD ISSUE: this does not include latest changes, allowing "data[b1000"...
I get the impression from Jeff that this latest version is not exactly
	being supported, whatever that means...
I think the only diffs are bigger buffers.
