COMMON.DIR  This directory contains modules common to many utilities.
CCPMPC V1.0
Note that some use scd86a.a86 (containing 'jmp plm'),
	while others use scd.a86 ('jmp plmstart').  This should be cleaned up
	and made consistent for all utils.

I've chosen to use "scd.a86" (and "plmstart") for all utils, where possible.
	So far it's the only ".a86" module I'm using.
