HELP BUG: scrolls on line too far   *****
HELP BUG: should look at SYSDRIVE for HELP.HLP
HELP notes
2/7/83 Dave H. working on HELP.DAT   whf
1/28/83 installed latest fixes from Bruce... whf
10/21/82 I got the latest source from Bruce.
It won't work under CP/M-86 without the [NOPAGE] option, since it
	calls Func 6 for direct input when it asks RETURN to continue...
HELP ISSUE: modifications to HELP.DAT are scheduled (I hope).
