
BOOT TRACKS CONSTRUCTION FOR THE COMPUPRO

The loader, which resides on the system tracks, is created with
the following sequence of commands:

;; The following sequence of commands may be executed from
;;   a SUBMIT file.
;
RASM86 DSKBOOT
;
LINK86 DSKBOOT.SYS=DSKBOOT[DATA[ORIGIN[0]]]
;
RASM86 LBIOS
;
RASM86 LPROG
;
LINK86 LBIOS3.SYS=LBIOS,LPROG[DATA[ORIGIN[180]]]
;
;; GENLDR will create the CPMLDR.SYS
;
GENLDR [NNNN]
;
;; NNNN:0000 is where cpmldr will be loaded at boot time, so be careful that
;; CCPM.SYS will not be loaded over your cpmldr.
;;
;; End of the SUBMIT file

Now read in the file DSKBOOT.SYS with DDT86 (this can't be done under
SUBMIT) and remove the header and base page.  This will allow you to
merge this into the CPMLDR file.

	A>DDT86
	-RDSKBOOT.SYS
	  START       END
	aaaa:0000 aaaa:37f
	-WBOOT,180,37F
	-^C

Now merge the two files with the following command line:

	A>PIP BOOTTRKS=BOOT[O],CPMLDR.SYS[O]

Assemble and link the track copy utility with the following commands:

	A>RASM86 TCOPY

	A>LINK86 TCOPY

The final step is to execute TCOPY under a version of CP/M-86 1.X.

****************************************************************
**** | Because TCOPY does direct BIOS calls, it will not  | ****
**** | execute under any other operating system.          | ****
****************************************************************


	A>TCOPY BOOTTRKS

You should now have a system loader on the boot tracks that will
load a file called CCPM.SYS into memory and begin system ececution.
