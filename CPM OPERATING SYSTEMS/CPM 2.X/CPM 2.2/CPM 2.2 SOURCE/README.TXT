Comparison of Caldera's PLM.ZIP file (215.462 bytes, 1997-10-14 21:22,
CRC 65A8) and this very archive reveals the following difference:

- One particular file OS3BDOS.ASM has the same file length in both issues,
  but different checksums. Both files differ in a single short sequence
  of code, but they do differ, and hence the Caldera issue should be
  preserved as well. 
It has been added to this archive under the name of "OS3BDOS1.ASM".
