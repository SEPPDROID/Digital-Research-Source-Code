This folder contains a disassembled source for CP/M 2.2 in both 8080, and Z80, mnemonics. This source is highly commented and claims to implement a fix for a problem with deblocking algorithms.

/READ.ME

The two files in this ZIP file are disassembled CP/M 2.2.

        CPM22.ASM       : CP/M 2.2 in 8080 mnemonics
        CPM22.Z80       : CP/M 2.2 in  Z80 mnemonics

Both files claim to implement a fix that affects operation in a sector
deblocking environment. The Z80 version does not look to have been optimized
for the Z80, it just uses Z80 mnemonics.
