GENERIC LOADER AND BIOS FOR CP/M PLUS
FOR CP/M-80 V2.2 SYSTEMS  UNBANKED  NO HASHING
BIOS PERFORMS BLOCKING/DEBLOCKING

	ORGANIZATIONAL COMMENTARY
	This BIOS is designed to be the user's first step
in making an upgrade from CP/M-80 v2.2 to CP/M Plus v3.0.
This BIOS will function properly in most CP/M-2 systems,
even those with the BIOS in PROM.

FUNCTION:
	This PROGRAM implements an UNBANKED, NON-HASHED,
UNBUFFERED BIOS for CP/M Plus version 3.0.

METHOD:
	CP/M Plus allows many levels of sophistocation in
the implementation of the BIOS.  At the highest levels,
the BIOS allows CP/M Plus to manage a potentially large
memory pool which acts like an instant access disk drive,
a substantial performence enhancement.  At the lowest level,
the performance of CP/M Plus is the same as that of CP/M-80
version 2.2.  This interface program is a simple implementation
of a CP/M Plus BIOS which operates as a parasite to the user's
existing BIOS for CP/M-80 version 2.2.

PURPOSE:
	This BIOS allows the CP/M-80 v2.2 user to easily
upgrade to CP/M Plus v3.0 and enjoy its logical enhancements
at the same level of performance he has enjoyed with v2.2.
This BIOS can be an end-point since system performance
will be satisfactory.  For users who own the hardware
required to implement hashing and buffering, this BIOS
will serve as a welcome starting point for further enhancement.
