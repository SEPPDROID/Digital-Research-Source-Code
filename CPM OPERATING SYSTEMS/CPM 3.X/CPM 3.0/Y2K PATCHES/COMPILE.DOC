Compiling CP/M-80 (PL/M modules)
================================

  The supplied source is (I hope) all that is necessary to build the four
modified CP/M programs.

  You will need the PLM80 compiler, the ASM80 assembler, and the ISIS
emulator. These can all be in separate directories.

  Edit ENV.BAT to set the four directories:

:F0:  source code directory
:F1:  PLM80 compiler
:F2:  ASM80 assembler
:F3:  ISIS emulator and libraries

and the path to ISIS.EXE (if it's on the search path, just SET ISIS=ISIS)

  Type MAKEPLM0 to see if you have the paths right for ISIS and ASM80. If so, 
follow it up with MAKECOM DATE, which uses the PLM80 paths for ISIS and PLM80.

Finally, type MAKE2000 to build all four modules.
