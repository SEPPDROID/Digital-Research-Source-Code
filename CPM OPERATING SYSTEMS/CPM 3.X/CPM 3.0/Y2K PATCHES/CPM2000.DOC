CP/M 3: Year 2000 fixes
=======================

  The following archive contains all CP/M 3 .COM files that use dates,
updated to operate correctly past the year 2000. They also allow dates to
be in US or UK format.

Operation: SETDEF
=================

  To use UK-format dates, type:

SETDEF [UK]

  To return to US-format dates, type:

SETDEF [US]

Operation: DATE
===============

  The year entered when dates are set can be 0-77 (meaning 2000-2077) or 78-99 
(meaning 1978-1999). The problem of what to do in 2078 is deferred to a later
revision of this program.

  Dates are now displayed with four-figure years.

  The US/UK setting applies to date entry and display.

Operation: DIR and SHOW
=======================

  DIR and SHOW display years above 2000 correctly (rather than as ":0") and
obey the US/UK setting.

Technical
=========

  The US/UK setting is stored in a previously unused SCB byte. I have checked 
all available sources on the SCB (including the BDOS source) to come up with
the following:

SCB + 0Ch  (xxA8h) bit 0: 0 for US, 1 for UK.

  This address is shown in the BDOS source as the low byte of an unused word
in the "Utilities" section of the SCB. ZPM3 does not use this byte either.

  My recommendation is that any other expansions to utilities should use the
remainder of this word to store settings.
