Compiling Caldera CP/M 3
========================

  The supplied source is (I hope) all that is necessary to build the CP/M 3
binary distribution.

  The Makefile is for GNU Make (as supplied with DJGPP). You will need the
the PL/M development system from the Unofficial CP/M Website. I have
supplied a prebuilt binary of ZXCC, the mini-emulator used to run build
tools such as RMAC.

  The PL/M system contains the PLM80 compiler, the ASM80 assembler, and the 
ISIS emulator. These can all be unpacked to separate directories.

  Edit ENV.BAT to set the four directories:

:F0:  source code directory
:F1:  PLM80 compiler
:F2:  ASM80 assembler
:F3:  ISIS emulator and libraries

and the path to ISIS.EXE (if it's on the search path, just SET ISIS=ISIS).
You will also need to set up the path to ISIS.EXE in the Makefile.

  MAKE ALL will then set the build in motion. Since the build tools do not
return error codes, you will have to watch for error messages yourself,
and stop the build if you see one.

  When GENCOM is being run, you may see a "corrupt FCB" message. This is
caused by GENCOM closing a file it didn't open, and you may safely ignore it.

  The build date is stored in three files:

MCD80A.ASM
MCD80F.ASM
MAKEDATE.LIB

and you should change all of these if you are making a new release.
