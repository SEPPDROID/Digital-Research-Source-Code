2.1  Overview
.pp
This section describes how to build a custom version of CP/M-8000 by combining 
your BIOS with the CCP and BDOS supplied by Digital Research to obtain a 
CP/M-8000 operating system suitable for your specific hardware system.  
Section 5 describes how to create a BIOS.
.pp
In this section, we assume that you have access to an already configured and
executable CP/M-8000 system.  If you do not, you should first read
Section 6, which discusses how you can make your first CP/M-8000 system
work.  === ACTUALLY, IT MAY BE SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE ===
.pp
A CP/M-8000 operating system is generated by using the linker, LD8K, to 
link together the system modules (CCP, BDOS, and BIOS) and
bind the system to an absolute memory location.  
The resulting file is the configured operating system.  It is named CPM.SYS.

The CCP and BDOS for CP/M-8000 are distributed in a library file named
CPMLIB.  You must link your BIOS with CPMLIB using the following command:

where BIOS.O is the compiled or assembled BIOS.  This creates CPM.SYS, which 
is an absolute version of your system.

2.3   Relocating Utilities
.pp
Since the utilities all run in non-segmented mode, they do not need to
be relocated:  they will run in whatever segments you have assigned
for the TPA.  Note that the compiler and linker require separate
code and data segments; all other utilities supplied with the system
run in a single segment.
