NAME
     xcon - convert Unidot Z8000 object file to x.out format

SYNOPSIS
     xcon [ -o outfile ] [ -s ] file.obj

DESCRIPTION
     _X_c_o_n reads the Unidot object file _f_i_l_e.obj and outputs the
     equivalent file in x.out format.  If the -o option is given,
     the output goes to the specified _o_u_t_f_i_l_e; otherwise the
     default x.out is used.  The output file is executable if it
     contains no unresolved external references.

     _X_c_o_n marks its output file as segmented if it encounters any
     Z8001-only relocation entries during the conversion; other-
     wise the output is marked as non-segmented.  The -s option
     will force a segmented output file regardless of the input.

FILES
     x.out

DIAGNOSTICS
