     NAME

          ar8k - archive and library maintainer


     SYNOPSIS

          ar8k key afile [name ...]


     DESCRIPTION

          The primary purpose of ar8k is to prepare and maintain files for
          the  linker, ld8k.  However, it may be used to prepare and main-
          tain collections of files for any other purpose.

          The format of the files is the same as that used by UNIX 7th Ed-
          ition.

          Key is one character from the set d-r-q-t-x, plus optionally v.

          Afile is the archive file.

          The [names ...] are files in the archive file, or  files  to  be
          included in the archive file.

          Meaning of the key letters is as follows:

          d  Delete the named files from the archive file

          r  Replace the named files in the archive file.   If  the  named
             files  are not currently in the archive file, they are placed
             at the end.

          q  Quickly append the named files to  the  end  of  the  archive
             file.   No  checking is done to see whether the files are al-
             ready in the archive.

          t  Print a table of contents.  If no names are given, the entire
             archive  is  listed,  otherwise  only the indicated files are
             listed.

          x  Extract the named files.  If there is no name list,  the  en-
             tire archive is extracted.  The archive file is not modified.

          v  Verbose.  With t, a long listing about each component is pro-
             duced.   With any other letter, a blow-by-blow description of
             all activity is produced.
