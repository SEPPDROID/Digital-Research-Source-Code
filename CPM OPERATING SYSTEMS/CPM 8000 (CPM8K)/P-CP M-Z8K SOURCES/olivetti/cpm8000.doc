                            CP/M-8000 Overview
                            ------------------
    CP/M-8000 is  a  proprietary,  general-purpose  control
    program designed  especially for microcomputers built
    around the Zilog Z8000 microprocessor family.
    CP/M-8000 is efficient and powerful.  CP/M-8000 systems
    can support application  programs that range from small
    to complex.  It has a time-tested, modular design.  The
    system modules include:
         o The Console Command Processor (CCP) -- the human
           interface of  the operating system that parses and
           executes a user's commands.
         o The Basic Disk Operating System (BDOS)  --  the
           invariant portion  of  the  operating  system
           that  performs system services such as managing
           disk directories and files.
         o The  Basic  Input/Output  System  (BIOS)  --  the
           variant portion of the operating system that
           contains hardware-dependent input/output device
           handlers.
`
                     CP/M and CP/M-86 Compatibility
                     ------------------------------
    CP/M-8000 files are completely compatible with  CP/M
    Version  2.2 and CP/M-86 Version 1.1.  This simplifies
    conversions of CP/M and CP/M-86 software to run on
    CP/M-8000.
    The end  user  will  notice  no  significant  difference
    between CP/M-8000  and  previous  versions of CP/M.
    Commands such as DIR, TYPE, PIP, STAT, and ED respond the
    same  way  in  both  systems.  The  program  interface  is
    also unchanged -- CP/M-8000 calls for system services have
    the same function numbers  as  in  CP/M  and CP/M-86.
    It is easy to  upgrade  existing  CP/M  and  CP/M-86
    application software to run under CP/M-8000, because
    CP/M-8000 is so similar to its predecessors.  Although
    assembly language programs  will require  recoding,  high-
    level  language programs will recompile with little or no
    modification.
`
                             File Management
                             ---------------
    CP/M-8000 can support up to 16 logical drives, each
    containing up to 512 megabytes, for a maximum  of  8
    gigabytes of on-line storage.  Any one file can reach 32
    megabytes, with space dynamically allocated and released.
    Each device has a directory which maps each file's
    physical locations on the disk.  Disk definition tables
    in the BIOS translate this logical information to the
    physical characteristics of the disk.  This file system
    is identical to the file system supported by CP/M 2 and
    CP/M-86.
`
                            Development Tools
                            -----------------
    Digital Research offers a set of development tools  for
    CP/M-8000 which can be run using CP/M-8000 or on a VAX-11
    or PDP-11 computer under the UNIX or VMS operating systems,
    or on a Zilog S8000 under the ZEUS operating system, or
    an Onyx C8000 running the Onix operating system.  These
    tools can be used to  develop CP/M-8000 applications or a
    custom CP/M-8000 BIOS.  The development tools include:
         o A C compiler and C runtime library compatible with
           UNIX (R) software.
         o An assembler, linker, and library utitilies.
         o A symbolic debugger.
         o An object file dumper which can display the headers,
           symbol table and relocation information in easily
           readable ASCII form.
    These tools are distributed at no extra charge with
    CP/M-8000, and can be run on CP/M-8000 systems with at
    least 128K of memory.

                                Utilities
                                ---------
    In  addition  to  the  development  tools  described 
    previously, CP/M-8000 is supplied with a set of file
    management utilities:
       PIP The Peripheral Interchange Program provides file
           transfer between  devices and disk files.  Various
           reformatting and concatenation operations may also
           be performed  with  PIP.
        ED The CP/M-8000 text editor allows creation and
           modification of ASCII files using extensive
           commands:  string substitution, string search,
           insert, delete and  block  move.  ED allows  text
           to  be  located  by context, line number, or
           relative position.  A macro command allows making
           extensive text changes with a single command line.
      STAT The STAT utility alters and displays I/O device
           and  file status including free space computations, 
           status of online disk(ette)s and physical-to-logical
           device assignment.

                          Hardware Requirements
                          ---------------------
    The version of CP/M-8000 that Digital Research ships and
    supports requires  an Olivetti M20 with at least 256Kb of
    memory.  CP/M-8000 may be reconfigured for a custom
    hardware environment using the development tools supplied
    with the system.  Custom hardware environments must
    include:
         o A Zilog Z8001, Z8002, Z8003 or Z8004 CPU.
         o At least 128K of RAM.
         o One to 16 disk drives of up to 512 megabytes each.
         o An ASCII console Device such as a CRT.

                          --------------------
    CP/M-8000 will be available from Digital Research in the
    first quarter of 1983.  At that time, two CP/M-8000
    products will be made available:

           5 1/4 inch diskettes plus CP/M-8000 documentation.
         o CP/M-8000 documentation only, consisting of four
           manuals:
                o The CP/M-8000 User's Guide
                o The CP/M-8000 Programmer's Guide
                o The CP/M-8000 System Guide
