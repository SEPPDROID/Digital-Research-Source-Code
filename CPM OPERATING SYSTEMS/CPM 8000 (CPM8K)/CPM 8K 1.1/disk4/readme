12/19/84The present release of CP/M-8000 you have just recieved is slightly restructured. the bios assembly modules have been setup for conditionalassembly through 2 modules their names are lbiosasm.8kn and biosasm.8knthese have one equate which controls the differences between the loaderspecific and normal bios assembler modules. By doing these modules thisway the system is reduced by 2k in size and removes the need for duplicatefiles. The bios.c module has changed little; added are simple protocall on the serial port. I have also run in to a problem with the new ZCC compilerthe -D option no longer works so now the loader define must be set to 1 at the beginning of bios.c in order to produce a LOADER BIOS.COPY.Z8K is now provided with the systemA new and working DDT.Z8K that portable and supports floatin point instructions note that there is a new entry in the bios memory region table for ddt..A new version of the C compiler which fixes numerous bugs in all programming areas. A much faster ld8k is providedA asz8k that supports floating point Numerous bug fixes to the library At a later date their will be a Segmented library provideda newer compiler, assembler,and linker. a later date their will be a Segmented library provideda newer compiler, assembler,and linker.
