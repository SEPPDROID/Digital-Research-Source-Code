       CP/M-68K Cross Software for VMS                            Page 2
       Introduction


       1.0  Introduction

            This  document  describes  the  installation  and  execution
       procedures  for  the  Digital  Research  68000  cross development
       software for VAX/VMS.  This software  includes  the  C  compiler,
       assembler,  linker,  archiver, symbol table print utility, object
       module size utility,  and  S-Record  conversion  utility.   These
       tools execute in much the same fashion as they do under CP/M-68K,
       as documented in the CP/M-68K Programmer's Guide.

       2.0  Installation Procedures

            The tools are distributed on a 9-track FLX format  mag  tape
       (either  800 or 1600 bpi is available).  To bring up the software
       on VMS, perform the following steps:

           1. Login to a valid account.

           2. Create directories for four ersatz devices:  "bin:"  (.exe
              files),  "com:"  (command  files), "lib:" (library files),
              and "cpm:" (CP/M-68K files).

           3. Enter VMS  "ASSIGN"  commands  for  these  directories  in
              LOGIN.COM, e.g:

              $ assign drb0:[c.bin] bin:
              $ assign drb0:[c.com] com:
              $ assign drb0:[c.lib] lib:
              $ assign drb0:[c.cpm] cpm:

              Note that the full path name must be specified.

           4. Perform  the  above  assignments  manually,  re-login   or
              re-execute LOGIN.COM to make the device names valid.

           5. Read the tape as follows:

              $ allocate mt:
              $ mount mt:/foreign
              $ set def lib:
              $ mcr flx /rs=mt:[1,1]*.*/do/im
              $ mcr flx /rs=mt:[1,2]*.*/do
              $ set def bin:
              $ mcr flx /rs=mt:[1,3]*.*/do
              $ set def cpm:
              $ mcr flx /rs=mt:[1,4]*.*/do/im
              $ mcr flx /rs=mt:[1,5]*.*/do
              $ set def com:
              $ mcr flx /rs=mt:[1,6]*.*/do
              $ @install
              $ dismount mt:
              $ deallocate mt:

       Installation Procedures


              You may need to replace the "mt:" device name above with a
              different device name, depending on the type of tape drive
              you have.  Consult your system administrator for details.

           6. Add the statements in the file "xlogin.com"  to  LOGIN.COM
              so  that  the  proper command definitions are performed at
              login time.

       Once the above steps have been performed, the software  is  ready
       to use on VMS.

       3.0  Operating Instructions

            The following sections describe how  to  run  the  installed
       cross software on VMS.

       3.1  C compilation

            A C compilation is performed  using  the  'c68'  command  as
       follows:

               $ c68 file

       The ".c" extension is implied and must  not  be  specified.   The
       'c68'  command  is  extremely  similar  to the 'C' SUBMIT file on
       CP/M-68K.  Default floating point format is  Motorola  FFP  using
       the "c68" command.  The "ce68" command causes the compiler to use
       IEEE format floating point numbers.

       3.2  Assembly

            The assembler is invoked in exactly the same  manner  as  on
       CP/M-68K.  The output (listing and errors) can be redirected to a
       file or device using the ">filename" construct.  A sample command
       is:

               $ as68 -l -u -p file.s >file.lis

       This  command  assembles  "file.s"  and  places  the  object   in
       "file.o".   The  listing  is output to "file.lis".  All assembler
       options valid under CP/M-68K may be used on VMS as well.

       3.3  Linking

            The LO68 program is used with the same options  and  command
       line syntax as on CP/M-68K.  For example,

            $ lo68 -r -o file.rel file1.o file2.o

       links "file1.o" with "file2.o", creating "file.rel",  a  relocat-
       able format file.

       CP/M-68K Cross Software for VMS                            Page 4
       Operating Instructions


            C programs are linked using the  "clink"  command,  as  with
       CP/M-68K:

            $ clink file1

       This links "file1.o" with  the  C  runtime  software  to  produce
       "file1.rel",  a relocatable format 68000 load module.  Separately
       compiled modules may be linked in the following way:

            $ clink file1 file2 file3 file4 ...

       All of the object files are linked  to  produce  "file1.rel".   A
       limit of 9 such files is imposed by the command file.

            The "clink" command procedure assumes that the program being
       linked  does not use floating point.  To link a program using FFP
       floating point, use "clinkf" instead of "clink".   IEEE  floating
       point  programs  (those  compiled  with  the  "ce68" command) are
       linked using "clinke".

       3.4  Archive Files

            The CP/M-68K archive program (AR68) can be  used  under  VMS
       exactly  in  the same fashion as under CP/M-68K.  For example, to
       create a library file:

               $ ar68 r lib a.o b.o c.o 

       This command creates a library called "lib" containing the  three
       files "a.o", "b.o", and "c.o".

       4.0  Building CP/M-68K

            Using the VAX cross tools to build CP/M-68K  is  similar  to
       building  the  operating  system on CP/M.  You link the BIOS with
       CPMLIB to produce a relocatable image file  (CPM.REL).   Use  the
       RELOC  utility  to create the absolute load image (CPM.SYS).  The
       CP/M-68K SUBMIT  files  "LCPM.SUB"  and  "RELCPM.SUB"  have  been
       adapted to VMS procedure files to make this process easier.

            For example, to create the EXORmacs distribution system, use
       the following sequence of commands:

               $ set def cpm:
               $ @normbios      !Create "bios.o"
               $ @lcpm  !Create "cpm.rel"
               $ @relcpm 15000 !Create CPM.SYS at 15000 hex.

       The boot loader for CP/M-68K is generated in a  similar  fashion,
       as documented in the CP/M-68K System Guide.

       File Transfer Techniques


       5.0  File Transfer Techniques


       5.1  S-records

            The normal method of transferring files to a 68000 target is
       via  Motorola  S-records.   The  SENDC68  program converts a load
       module file from binary format to S-record format.   The  command
       syntax for this program is:

               SENDC68 [-] file.68k >file.sr

       Where "file.68k" is an absolute format CP/M-68K load module,  and
       "file.sr"  is  the  created S-record file.  This form of the load
       module may be created using the linker "-t" switch or  the  reloc
       utility.   The  RELCPM  command  used  in the CP/M-68K generation
       procedure generates an absolute file.  The "-"  option  specifies
       that S-records are not to be created for the ".bss" segment.  The
       default is to create S-records that zero  all  locations  in  the
       ".bss".  

            The resulting S-record file may be downloaded  via  the  VMS
       "TYPE" command into a target system with a PROM debugger, such as
       the MACSbug program on the EXORmacs.  

       5.2  Other Transfer Techniques

            Other techniques such as binary download utilities  or  CP/M
       file  transfer  utilities  may  be used to transfer CP/M-68K load
       modules to the 68000 target.  When such a technique is used,  the
       bytes  in the file must be swapped, and the words of all longword
       quantities in the load module header must  be  swapped.   Library
       modules  may  not  be  transferred  using  this technique without
       extensive rearrangement of the  headers.   The  symbol  table  in
       object  and  load  module  files  will have the symbol names byte
       swapped in this type of transfer.
