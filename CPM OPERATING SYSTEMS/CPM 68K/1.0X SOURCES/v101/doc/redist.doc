OVERVIEW

     This  document describes how to redistribute CP/M-68K.   The 

CP/M-68K operating system is distributed by Digital Research as a 

set  of five 8" diskettes which contain the files which  the  end 

user  will receive.   A sixth diskette contains a serializer pro

gram and several related files.   To generate an end user copy of 

CP/M-68K,  the  contents  of the first five diskettes  should  be 

copied to appropriate media,  then serialized.   In addition, the 

media shipped to an end user should contain a CPM.SYS file  which 

has  been configured for the end user's hardware,  and should  be 

bootstrappable on the target hardware.   Configuring CP/M-68K for 

particular hardware is discussed in the CP/M-68K Operating System 

System Guide.  


COPYING CP/M-68K

     The  procedure for copying CP/M-68K may vary depending  upon 

the media which are to be distributed to the end user.  Normally, 

CP/M-68K  will  be  distributed to end users on a  set  of  disks 

compatible  with the target computer.   These disks may be copied 

from  a set of masters using the COPY utility program  (described 

in  the CP/M-68K Operating System User's Guide.)  Once  the  copy 

has been done,  the disks must be serialized using the serializer 

program  supplied  with the OEM kit.   The serialized copies  may 

then be shipped to end users.


USING THE SERIALIZER

     The  serializer  program is named  SERIAL.REL.   It  may  be 

relocated  using  RELOC  (see Programmer's Guide) or  renamed  to 

SERIAL.68K.   The serializer is invoked by a command line of  the 

form:

          A>SERIAL  start end

where 'start' is the first serial number to be used, and 'end' is 

the last serial number to be used.  The serializer will serialize 

a  set of disks.   The first disk serialized will have 'start' as 

its serial number,  the second disk will have 'start' + 1 as  its 

serial  number,  ...  the last disk will have 'end' as its serial 

number.  The serializer expects to find a file named 'SERIAL.DAT' 

on  the default drive.   This file contains a list of  the  files 

which must be serialized.  After the serializer has been invoked, 

it  will prompt you for the drive letter on which the disk to  be 

serialized is mounted.  Then, for each disk to be serialized, the 

serializer will prompt you to insert the disk into the drive.  As 

each  file is serialized,  the serializer will indicate the  file 

being  serialized  and whether or not the serialization was  com

plete.   The  completion  message will include an  integer  whose 

value varies according to which file is being serialized.

     The  serializer  disk contains several files in addition  to 

the  serializer  program proper.   There are five  submit  files, 

named SERIAL1.SUB,  SERIAL2.SUB,  ... , SERIAL5.SUB, which can be 

executed to serialize user disks one to five respectively.   Each 

submit  file  takes two parameters:  the first  and  last  serial 

numbers  to be used in serializing the disk in  question.   There 

are also five data files,  named SERIAL1.DAT,  ...  , SERIAL5.DAT 

which  list the files to serialize on user disk 1,  user disk  2, 

etc.   All  the  files  named in the SERIALx.DAT  files  MUST  be 

serialized.   If  you reorganize the way the files are placed  on 

the  disks for shipment,  you will need to create new  SERIAL.DAT 

files.
