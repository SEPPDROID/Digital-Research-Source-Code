The initial shipments of CP/M-68K had a problem in writing Ascii
files using the C run-time library.  The patch described below
fixes the problem.  

	A>AR68 X CLIB WRITE.O	(extract module WRITE.O from library CLIB)
	A>DDT
	-RWRITE.O		(read file WRITE.O into memory)
	  start xxxxxxxx  end yyyyyyyy
	-Hxxxxxxxx,164		(xxxxxxxx is the start in memory of the file)
	 zzzzzzzz wwwwwwww	(zzzzzzzz is the sum of 164H and xxxxxxxx)
	-Dzzzzzzzz		(display memory at zzzzzzzz)
	zzzzzzzz: 67 18 33 FC ...  	(memory contents)
		...
		...

	-Szzzzzzzz
	zzzzzzzz 67 60		(change byte from 67 to 60)
	uuuuuuuu 18 .		(display next byte -- don't change)
	-WWRITE.O		(write out changed file)
	-^C			(Control-C to exit DDT)
	A>AR68 RV CLIB WRITE.O	(Replace module WRITE.O in library CLIB)

	...			(Archiver types confirmation messages)

	A>ERA WRITE.O

The effect of the above sequence is to replace one byte in the run-time
library.  The byte changed is at offset 164H in object module WRITE.O,
from 67H to 60H.
