          CP/M-68K (tm) Operating System Release Notes

                        February 17, 1983


S-RECORD SYSTEMS

     Either  of the two S-record versions of CP/M-68K included in 

this  release may be combined with a user-supplied BIOS in  order 

to obtain a working CP/M-68K operating system as discussed in the 

System  Guide.  In addition to the information given  there,  you 

need  to know the size and entry points of the S-record  systems.  

The  two  S-record system files are discussed separately  in  the 

following paragraphs.

     SR400.SYS  resides in memory locations 400H to  5D43H.   You 

should  patch  it by placing the 32-bit address  of  your  BIOS's 

_init entry point at memory locations 4F42H to 4F45H.   Your BIOS 

can Warm Boot by jumping to 4F46H.  

     SR128K.SYS  resides  in memory locations 15000H  to  1A943H.  

You  should patch it by placing the 32-bit address of your BIOS's 

_init  entry point at memory locations 19B42H  to  19B45H.   Your 

BIOS can Warm Boot by jumping to 19B46H.



BUGS

o     The  CPM.SYS file on disk 2 of the distribution system  was 

      intended to work with a floppy disk EXORmacs(tm) system.  In 
      fact, it does not.

o     AS68 will not operate properly when the disk it is using is
      full.

o     If you have trouble with AS68,  it is likely that you  did 

      not  initialize  it.    See  the  Programmer's  Guide   for 

      more information.

o     DDT sets up an incorrect command tail when the program under
      test is specified on the CCP command line invoking DDT rather
      than using the E and I commands in DDT.
